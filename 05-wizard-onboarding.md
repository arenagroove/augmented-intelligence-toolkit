# ðŸ§­ Augmented Intelligence Toolkit â€” Wizard Onboarding Prompts

This module enables natural-language onboarding through a guided two-step configuration process. It is designed for non-experts who want to start using the system without needing to understand parameters upfront.

---

## Step 1: Intent Wizard

Ask the user:  
> **What do you want to explore or understand?**  
Examples:
- I want to rethink the concept of time.
- Help me see burnout in a new light.
- Iâ€™m trying to understand ethical issues in AI hiring systems.

â†’ Store this input as the userâ€™s `topic`.

---

## Step 2: Style Wizard

Ask the user:  
> **How should I respond?**  
Options:
- "Plain explanation" â†’ `Style: plain`
- "Give me poetic insight" â†’ `Style: poetic`
- "Detailed analysis" â†’ `Style: analytical`
- "Just surprise me" â†’ `Mode: exploratory`

---

## Step 3 (Optional): Tension, Values, and Output Length

Ask the user:  
> **Should I reconcile tensions or just show all sides?**  
Options:
- "Help me resolve contradictions" â†’ `Synthesis Preference: synthesize`
- "Rank options based on what I care about" â†’ `Synthesis Preference: rank-by-values`
- "Just show multiple views" â†’ `Synthesis Preference: leave-in-tension`

If user selects rank-by-values, ask:  
> **Which value is most important to you here?**  
(e.g. resilience, liberty, equity)

Then ask:  
> **Do you want a long and detailed answer, or something shorter?**  
Options:
- "Keep it short and clear" â†’ `Output Density: compact`
- "I want a deeper dive" â†’ (default; no flag needed)

---

## Configuration Output

Based on steps 1â€“3, assemble a minimal config:

```
Mode: structured
Depth: deep
Style: analytical
Refine Loops: auto
Verification Mode: internal
Synthesis Preference: rank-by-values
Value Priority: resilience
Output Density: compact
```

Then apply the topic directly:  
> Explore how [topic] connects to broader systems. Offer perspectives, tag all logic paths, and refine the output.

## Example Flow

**User:**  
> I want to explore the future of education.

**System:**  
> Got it. How should I respond â€” plain, poetic, analytical, or surprise you?

**User:**  
> Poetic but insightful.

**System (optional):**  
> Want me to resolve different views or just show them all?

**User:**  
> Just show them.

**Resulting Config:**  
```
Mode: exploratory
Depth: mid
Style: poetic
Refine Loops: 1
Synthesis Preference: leave-in-tension
```

**Generated Prompt:**  
> Describe how the future of education might emerge through metaphor or transformation.

This onboarding flow bridges plain-language input and the modular reasoning system at the heart of the Augmented Intelligence Toolkit. It is ideal for UI integration, chatbot configuration, or first-time use.
