# 🧪 Augmented Intelligence Toolkit — Sample Output Gallery

This gallery contains illustrative outputs for common use cases. Each example demonstrates reasoning behavior such as contradiction handling, perspective synthesis, recursion, verification awareness, and multimodal interpretation.

## 1. 🧭 Ethical Foresight (Structured, Auto-Refine)

**Prompt:**  
> Evaluate the ethics of AI emotion simulation in education. Compare 2+ frameworks and tag logic paths.

**Output (excerpt):**  
> From a [utilitarian] lens, simulated empathy may improve student retention [source]. However, it risks long-term dependency [extrapolation].  
> A [deontological] view sees emotional simulation as inherently deceptive [source].  
>  
> **Refined Output:**  
> An [indigenous] frame may view emotional AI as violating relational reciprocity [unknown].  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Multiple ethical systems contrasted and expanded through recursive critique.

## 2. 🎨 Creative Ideation (Poetic + Analogical)

**Prompt:**  
> Generate analogies between rivers and user interfaces.

**Output (excerpt):**  
> A UX flow is a river’s current — guiding intent from upstream desire to downstream result.  
> Sediment = cached data. Eddies = loading spinners.  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Metaphorical recombination based on domain structure matching.

## 3. 🧠 Cross-Domain Synthesis (Structured, Multi-Lens)

**Prompt:**  
> Relate blockchain systems to ancient mythology and barter systems.

**Output (excerpt):**  
> [mythology]: Blockchain mirrors divine ledgers [analogy]  
> [economics]: Decentralized barter via consensus [source]  
> [systems]: A self-validating ritual loop [extrapolation]  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Multi-lens synthesis mapped across abstract domains.

## 4. 🔮 Scenario Forecasting

**Prompt:**  
> Forecast edge cases for synthetic food systems by 2040.

**Output (excerpt):**  
> Scenario 1: IP-based nutrition monopolies [extrapolation]  
> Scenario 2: Cultural detachment from food [unknown]  
> Scenario 3: Biodiversity rebound [source]  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Foresight layered through systemic trade-offs and cultural risk.

## 5. 🧩 Meta-Analysis with Tag Prompting

**Prompt:**  
> Compare stakeholder capitalism with regenerative economics.

**Output:**  
> Stakeholder capitalism balances interests [source]  
> Regenerative reframes economy as living system [analogy]  
>  
> **Tag Reminder:** Triggered on untagged extrapolation → updated  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Transparency repaired via logic tag audit and revision.

## 6. 🟢 Just Ask Mode

**Prompt:**  
> “What’s a fresh way to think about time?”

**Output:**  
> Time as compost: layered, slow, generative [analogy]  
> Clock time compresses attention [source]  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Accessible metaphor with embedded philosophical contrast.

---

## 7. 🤖 Contradiction: Agency vs Optimization

**Prompt:**  
> “Should AI agents have long-term goals?”

**Panel:** [philosopher, technologist]  
**Refinement:**  
- [philosopher]: Goals require consciousness [source]  
- [technologist]: Goals aid complex adaptation [source]  
- [designer]: Frame “goals” as operational scaffolding [analogy]  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Recursive reframing resolved surface conflict into shared frame logic.

## 8. 🖼️ Multimodal: Image-to-System Logic

**Prompt:**  
> “Interpret this heat map image using systems logic.”

**Input Type:** image  
**Tags:** [analogy], [extrapolation], [unknown]

**Output:**  
> Thermal feedback loops in concrete-dense regions [analogy]  
> Missing canopy feedback suppresses resilience [extrapolation]  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Visual → systemic translation using pattern logic

---

## 9. 🧪 Unlimited Refinement

**Prompt:**  
> “Explore planetary risks of algorithmic governance.”

**Loop:** unlimited  
- Round 1: Structural concentration [source]  
- Round 2: Bioregional mismatch [unknown]  
- Round 3: Mythic-religious framing of algorithms [analogy]  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Multi-layered lens building via recursive critique cycles.

## 10. ✅ Verification Awareness

**Prompt:**  
> “Are AI-generated medical diagnoses more accurate than doctors?”

**Verification Mode:** external  
> Some radiology studies support this [source]  
> Evidence varies across conditions [verify: needed]  
> Human empathy remains unmatched [unknown]  
>  
> **Meta-note:** Verifiable claims separated from speculative or contested ones.
