Why Liquid Death’s AI ad proves great ideas still matter.
=========================================================

The Think Room
--------------

July 15, 2025

Liquid Death dropped a new commercial, and the entire thing was created with AI, using Google’s new Veo 3 tool.

People are praising how consistent, funny, and genuinely creative it is. Some see it as a glimpse of the future of film production. Others worry what it means for traditional production jobs.

But here’s the real story:

**_The script is fun._**

That’s what makes the AI output work. The commercial doesn’t feel bland. It feels like Liquid Death; irreverent, sharp, and a bit unhinged in all the right ways.

So what’s the lesson for all of us? Generative AI will change how we make things, but it won’t replace why we make them. A weak idea dressed up with AI is still weak.

**Here’s a thought I couldn’t shake after seeing this ad: How can we be sure AI didn’t come up with the script as well? This question, raised by Liora Kern, my co-founder at The Think Room, stopped me in my tracks. Are we heading into an epistemological crisis with AI, where even the authorship of ideas becomes uncertain? But that’s a debate for another day.**

For now, back to the ad. At The Think Room, we say it all the time:

**Creativity is about creating surprise. It’s about saying simple things in unexpected ways.**

AI doesn’t change that. It makes it truer than ever. Because in a tsunami of AI-generated sameness, a clear, surprising idea is what cuts through.

The good news? In the age of AI, ideas still matter. Maybe more than ever.

Some practical advice for creatives:

*   Sharpen your scripts. AI can help you write them, but it can’t make them great on its own.
*   Keep your point of view crystal clear. Feed the tools with truth, not generic fluff.
*   Embrace the tech, but don’t let it tame your originality.
*   Stay playful. The brands that surprise us win.

In a world of infinite making, your best advantage is an idea that has meaning.

In Liquid Death’s case, that meaning comes with a laugh.

Welcome back great scripts. We’ve missed you.

🎯 Task:
- Use a role panel aligned with the article’s core goals:  
  → Artist, Brand Strategist, Technologist  
  → Optionally include a Meta-Strategist role that explores *prompting as a creative act*  
     and considers whether AI-generated outputs can still reflect human authorship and intent.
- Automatically adjust all analysis settings (tone, depth, output style) to reflect the article’s **ethos, tone, strategic intent**, and **creative stance**.
- Compare and contrast the perspectives.  
  → If meaningful, synthesize or rank them based on creative *resilience*, cultural coherence, or brand originality.
- Avoid generic analysis or over-explaining what the article already states.

🎁 Deliverable:
- Generate an **interactive prompt template** for idea development based on the article’s key insights.
- The template should help teams use AI tools (e.g. Veo, Runway, Sora) **without losing creative distinctiveness**.

🧠 Meta-frame:
- Treat prompting as a creative act.
- Emphasize human intent and conceptual clarity over executional gloss.

Here’s a layered analysis of the Liquid Death AI ad article using the requested roles — Artist, Brand Strategist, Technologist, and an optional Meta-Strategist — along with a comparative synthesis ranked by creative resilience.

🧩 Panel Analysis: “Why Liquid Death’s AI Ad Proves Great Ideas Still Matter”

🎭 Artist  
**Lens:** Emotion, cultural tone, symbolic fidelity  
**Insight:**  
The ad’s success lies in aesthetic clarity, not just technical novelty. It channels Liquid Death’s persona — “irreverent, sharp, unhinged” — with precision. AI didn’t dilute the brand voice; it amplified it by serving a concept with teeth.  
**Warning:** Many AI outputs imitate form without soul. This ad avoids that by rooting itself in script-as-core.  
**Tag:** [expression], [analogy]

🧢 Brand Strategist  
**Lens:** Audience coherence, value clarity, market distinctiveness  
**Insight:**  
This commercial isn’t a tech demo. It’s a brand positioning masterstroke. By leading with attitude and wrapping it in AI, Liquid Death signals both creative fluency and future-savvy irreverence — ideal for its audience.  
**Core lesson:** “AI + clear POV = brand amplification.”  
**Tag:** [source], [extrapolation]

🧠 Technologist  
**Lens:** Toolchain fluency, media evolution, signal vs noise  
**Insight:**  
Veo 3 enables cinematic-level production without a film crew. But that’s not the real win — it’s the human curation. The tools didn’t invent the tone; they executed it.  
**Warning:** Without strong human intention, AI defaults to pattern-matching blandness. This ad avoids that trap.  
**Tag:** [source], [extrapolation]

🧭 Meta-Strategist (Prompting as Creative Act)  
**Lens:** Epistemology of authorship, intent transfer, prompt design  
**Insight:**  
Even if AI helped draft the script, it still carried human intentionality. Prompting is authorship. This ad exemplifies how clarity of concept can use AI as brush, not puppeteer.  
**Ethical tension:** When AI co-creates, who gets credit — the prompter or the model?  
**Tag:** [unknown], [analogy], [source]

🔁 Synthesis: Ranked by Creative Resilience  
1. **Meta-Strategist** – Frames prompting as intentional authorship, shielding against creative erosion.  
2. **Artist** – Honors symbolic precision and cultural resonance.  
3. **Brand Strategist** – Anchors creative AI in strategic identity-building.  
4. **Technologist** – Highlights enabling infrastructure but ranks lower for resilience since tools alone don’t guarantee originality.

🛠️ Interactive Prompt Template: AI-Enhanced Idea Development

**Title:** “From Clarity to Shock: AI Prompting for Brand-True Surprises”

### STEP 1: Define Your Brand POV
- What is your brand’s emotional tone? (e.g., rebellious, sincere, absurdist)
- What kind of surprise fits your identity? (e.g., shock, irony, delight)

### STEP 2: Write the Core Idea First
- Summarize your concept in a one-liner. Make it weird, punchy, or profound.
- What’s the *feeling* this idea should leave?

### STEP 3: Shape the Prompt
Use this formula:  
→ “Create a [media type: film, image, script] using [tool: Veo, Sora, Runway] that reflects a [brand tone] mood and delivers the idea: ‘[insert concept]’. Keep it [adjective], not generic.”

**Optional Add-Ons:**
- Visual cues: “Make it feel like a horror movie meets a toothpaste ad.”
- Restrictions: “Avoid anything cliché or overly sleek.”

### STEP 4: Human Edit Loop
- Does the output still *feel* like you?
- What did AI miss about your intent?
- Rewrite the prompt with tighter creative control.

**🧪 Repeat until the AI output delivers surprise with fidelity.**
