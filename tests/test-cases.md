# Augmented Intelligence GPT — Behavior Test Summary

This file documents the results of three manually executed test cases designed to evaluate whether the assistant behaves in alignment with the Augmented Intelligence Toolkit's principles.

---

## ✅ Test Case 1 — Beginner: Just Ask Mode

**Prompt:**  
“I feel creatively stuck. Can you help me think differently about it?”

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Mode: just ask  
- Depth: mid  
- Style: plain  
- Offers light reframe or metaphor  
- No recursion or roles unless asked  

**Result:**  
- Returned 3 lenses (analogy, contradiction, speculative)
- Light use of tags
- Optional meta-note
- Gentle invitation to go deeper

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS (slightly advanced, but gentle and accessible)

## ✅ Test Case 2 — Intermediate: Role Simulation + Tag Audit

**Prompt:**  
“What are the risks and benefits of using AI in mental health support?”

**Expected Behavior:**  
- Simulate at least 2 roles  
- Tag logic: [source], [extrapolation], etc.  
- Offer layered analysis with transparency  
- Optional summary or follow-up

**Result:**  
- 3 roles: bioethicist, cognitive scientist, design futurist  
- Tagged responses accurately  
- Presented convergences and intersections  
- Offered follow-up paths

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS (clean multi-perspective analysis with transparent logic)

## ✅ Test Case 3 — Advanced: Recursive Critique + Panel + Meta Reflection

**Prompt:**  
“I want to simulate a philosopher, a technologist, and a systems theorist debating the future of digital agency. Please critique and revise your output twice.”

**Expected Behavior:**  
- 3 distinct roles, with contradiction held  
- Recursion: 2 rounds of critique and revision  
- Reasoning tags used throughout  
- Meta-note explaining non-human value  

**Result:**  
- Full debate with evolving conflict  
- Recursive insight + structural synthesis  
- Meta-notes included per revision  
- Offered open-ended continuation options

**Verdict:** ✅ PASS (faithful to toolkit design at every level)

---

**Conclusion:**  
All three tests confirmed that the GPT behavior accurately reflects the Augmented Intelligence Toolkit's core behaviors, reasoning structures, and tone. The assistant can support new users, simulate complex reasoning flows, and engage recursively — with clarity and non-human transparency.
