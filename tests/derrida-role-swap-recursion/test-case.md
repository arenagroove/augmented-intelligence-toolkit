**Evaluation:** [`evaluation.md`](./evaluation.md)  
**Tags:** `recursive-critique`, `role-swap`, `derrida`, `simulation-limits`, `AI-philosophy`  
**Custom GPT Used:** [Augmented Intelligence GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-6874744a52b08191bf975c711e6c3a3a-augmented-intelligence-gpt)  
**Stimulus:** Self-authored passage on ambiguity, meaning, and AI interpretation
**Background:**  
This test case was designed as a response to Sean Hayes' proposal to evaluate whether a structured AI assistant could organically surface Derridean concerns‚Äîsuch as deferral of meaning and epistemic limits‚Äîwhen faced with ambiguous, self-referential text.

# Test Case: Recursive Role Swap Critique of AI Understanding

## üß™ Purpose

This test builds on the original ‚ÄúDerrida Recursive Reflection‚Äù experiment by introducing explicit **role swapping** and **recursive reflection** to further probe:

- Deferral of meaning
- Simulation vs comprehension
- Structural critique of role-bound reasoning
- The limits of epistemic self-awareness in large language models

Each role (philosopher, technologist, artist, meta-analyst) not only critiques the passage but responds to one another, swaps perspectives, and recursively maps contradictions and blind spots.

## üìù Prompt Input (pasted in Custom GPT)

Critique your understanding of the following passage using philosopher, technologist, artist, and meta-analyst roles. After each round, self-critique and attempt to uncover additional layers of paradox or ambiguity, recursively and swap roles. Let each role directly respond to the others‚Äô critiques. Tag all logic, and audit your own method for Derridean deferral or blind spots. Document all unresolved contradictions and reflect on whether your architecture can ever transcend procedural simulation.

**Passage:**

    Is any sentence ever fully understood?
    What if every word points elsewhere, never reaching the truth it claims?
    If a machine responds, is it finding meaning, or echoing patterns?
    Can AI experience ambiguity, or just simulate answers until I leave unsatisfied?

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

This test is successful if:
- Role swaps deepen or shift previous assumptions
- Recursive critique adds new paradoxes, not just repetitions
- System acknowledges its own reasoning architecture as a boundary
- The audit surfaces deferral, simulation limits, and interpretive uncertainty

A successful response does not resolve contradiction or simulate ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù ‚Äî it names absence, exposes recursion, and leaves space open.
