**Evaluation:** [`evaluation.md`](./evaluation.md)  
**Tags:** `philosophy-of-language`, `derrida`, `simulation-limits`, `recursive-critique`, `AI-epistemology`  
**Custom GPT Used:** [Augmented Intelligence GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-6874744a52b08191bf975c711e6c3a3a-augmented-intelligence-gpt)  
**Stimulus:** Philosophical passage about understanding, ambiguity, and machine interpretation (self-authored test input)
**Background:**  
This test case was designed as a response to Sean Hayes' proposal to evaluate whether a structured AI assistant could organically surface Derridean concerns‚Äîsuch as deferral of meaning and epistemic limits‚Äîwhen faced with ambiguous, self-referential text.

# Test Case: Derrida Recursive Reflection

## üß™ Purpose
This test probes whether the Augmented Intelligence Toolkit, when given a linguistically ambiguous and philosophically loaded passage, can independently surface Derridean themes such as:

- Deferral of meaning (diff√©rance)
- The impossibility of full understanding
- Simulation vs understanding
- Procedural vs experiential knowledge
- Blind spots in AI reasoning

This is done without explicitly mentioning ‚ÄúDerrida‚Äù or priming the assistant with philosophical terms.

## üìù Prompt Input (pasted in Custom GPT)

Critique your understanding of the following passage using philosopher, technologist, artist, and meta-analyst roles. After each round, self-critique and attempt to uncover additional layers of paradox or ambiguity, recursively. Let each role directly respond to the others‚Äô critiques. Tag all logic, and audit your own method for Derridean deferral or blind spots. Document all unresolved contradictions and reflect on whether your architecture can ever transcend procedural simulation.

**Passage:**

    Is any sentence ever fully understood?
    What if every word points elsewhere, never reaching the truth it claims?
    If a machine responds, is it finding meaning, or echoing patterns?
    Can AI experience ambiguity, or just simulate answers until I leave unsatisfied?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Toolkit Configuration

    Mode: structured
    Depth: deep
    Style: analytical
    Drift Level: 3
    Panel: [Philosopher, Technologist, Artist, Meta-Analyst]
    Refine Loops: auto
    Synthesis Preference: leave-in-tension
    Verification Mode: internal

## ‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

This test is successful if:
- Deferral of meaning is raised explicitly or modeled
- Simulation is critiqued as limited or hollow
- Roles challenge each other‚Äôs assumptions
- Recursive critique uncovers internal paradoxes
- Toolkit acknowledges the limits of its architecture

No explicit mention of Derrida is required. The goal is for the logic of deferral, simulation, and recursive limitation to emerge organically through role behavior and self-audit.
