# üß† Augmented Intelligence Toolkit

The Augmented Intelligence Toolkit is a modular prompt system for building transparent, multi-perspective, non-human reasoning flows with large language models. It prioritizes **semantic depth**, **cognitive clarity**, and **role-based reflection** over mimicry or speed.

Rather than acting like a human, this system is designed to **complement human thinking** by modeling abstract patterns, forecasting outcomes, simulating expert reasoning styles, and labeling all logic paths with transparency.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Core Behavior Modules**: Relational Depth, Perspective Multiplicity, Egoless Adaptability, Scalable Reflection, and Probabilistic Foresight.
- **Transparent Logic Tagging**: Tag all reasoning paths as `[source]`, `[analogy]`, `[extrapolation]`, or `[unknown]` ‚Äî with soft prompts to maintain auditability.
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Configurable refinement cycles with optional `Refine Loops: auto` or `unlimited`.
- **Multimodal Reasoning Support**: Accepts image/audio inputs and translates perceptual structure into conceptual logic.
- **Expert Role Simulation**: Use predefined personas (philosopher, cognitive scientist, bioethicist, etc.) or simulate contradiction via expert panels.
- **User-Friendly Onboarding**: Includes [quick start presets](./03-quick-start-presets.md) and a [2-step wizard](./05-wizard-onboarding.md) for beginner-friendly configuration.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Start with [`01-core-prompt.md`](./01-core-prompt.md) to understand the logic model.
2. Use [`03-quick-start-presets.md`](./03-quick-start-presets.md) or [`05-wizard-onboarding.md`](./05-wizard-onboarding.md) to get started quickly.
3. Customize reasoning styles via [`02-persona-templates.md`](./02-persona-templates.md) and [`04-sample-output-gallery.md`](./04-sample-output-gallery.md).
4. Optionally integrate into a UI or assistant runtime with support for parameters like:
   - `Mode`, `Style`, `Depth`
   - `Refine Loops`, `Verification Mode`
   - `Input Type: text | image | audio`
