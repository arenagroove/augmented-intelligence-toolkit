# ðŸ§  Augmented Intelligence Toolkit

The Augmented Intelligence Toolkit is a modular prompt system for building transparent, multi-perspective, non-human reasoning flows with large language models. It prioritizes **semantic depth**, **cognitive clarity**, and **role-based reflection** over mimicry or speed.

Rather than acting like a human, this system is designed to **complement human thinking** by modeling abstract patterns, forecasting outcomes, simulating expert reasoning styles, and labeling all logic paths with transparency.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **Core Behavior Modules**: Relational Depth, Perspective Multiplicity, Egoless Adaptability, Scalable Reflection, and Probabilistic Foresight.
- **Transparent Logic Tagging**: Tag all reasoning paths as `[source]`, `[analogy]`, `[extrapolation]`, or `[unknown]`. Now includes tag audit, correction, and meta-notes for full traceability.
- **Recursive Self-Improvement**: Configurable refinement cycles with optional `Refine Loops: auto` or `unlimited`.
- **Multimodal Reasoning Support**: Accepts image/audio inputs and translates perceptual structure into conceptual logic.
- **Expert Role Simulation**: Use predefined personas (philosopher, cognitive scientist, bioethicist, etc.) or simulate contradiction via expert panels.
- **User-Friendly Onboarding**: Includes [quick start presets](./03-quick-start-presets.md) and a [2-step wizard](./05-wizard-onboarding.md) for beginner-friendly configuration.
- **Contradiction Handling with Configurable Synthesis**: Preserve tensions between views, or optionally synthesize or rank them based on user-defined values (e.g. equity, resilience).
- **Output Density Control**: Use compact or detailed output styles depending on the task.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Start with [`01-core-prompt.md`](./01-core-prompt.md) to understand the logic model.
2. Use [`03-quick-start-presets.md`](./03-quick-start-presets.md) or [`05-wizard-onboarding.md`](./05-wizard-onboarding.md) to get started quickly.
3. Customize reasoning styles via [`02-persona-templates.md`](./02-persona-templates.md) and [`04-sample-output-gallery.md`](./04-sample-output-gallery.md).
4. Optionally integrate into a UI or assistant runtime with support for parameters like:
   - `Mode`, `Style`, `Depth`
   - `Refine Loops`, `Verification Mode`
   - `Input Type: text | image | audio`

## ðŸ“˜ Philosophy and Approach

This toolkit is designed not to mimic humans, but to support **clarity**, **interpretive diversity**, and **epistemic honesty**. Itâ€™s ideal for use in:
- Design and systems thinking
- Ethical foresight and futures work
- Complex multi-domain problem exploration
- Auditable AI reasoning in research or policy contexts

## ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters

The Augmented Intelligence Toolkit isnâ€™t just a reasoning framework â€” itâ€™s a model for how AI can be used **ethically, transparently, and creatively**. Based on external reviews and validation, hereâ€™s what sets it apart:

- **Makes Complex Reasoning Understandable:** Organizes abstract ideas into visible, traceable steps with reasoning tags and simulated roles
- **Fosters Safe Exploration:** Surfaces tension and contradiction without risk â€” ideal for complex or emotionally charged topics
- **Centers Transparency and Adaptation:** Shows how every thought evolves, allowing users to revise, audit, or redirect the conversation
- **Supports Pattern Discovery and Forecasting:** Helps spot meaning across noise and imagine alternative futures:contentReference
- **Built to Augment, Not Replace:** Respects the human role â€” offering structure, not control; dialogue, not automation

Whether used for creative thinking, ethical reflection, or complex problem exploration, the Toolkit creates **epistemic space for thought to emerge, mutate, and clarify â€” with the user always in control.**
